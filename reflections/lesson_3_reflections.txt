Q1: when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all work local?
A1: For callaboration with other people, as a cloud backup in case the local machine becomes unavailable

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2: To avoid unintentional changes from other contributors working on the shared github repository to your local code. You want to have control on what changes/additions/deletions are necessary for you. 

Q3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A3: Forks: Forks are copies of repositories created using another repository on github
    Clones: clones are copies of repositories created locally by using another repository either stored locally or from github
    branches: branches are logical version separations within a repository used to distinguish code, contributors, features or modules

Q4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A4: It serves as a quick compare mechanism for your local copy and the remote contributions on gitthub

Q5: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A5: Using a Project Manager or emails :) but it would be harder and error prone
